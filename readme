Automaticly mounting and umounting of usb storages to the computer via udev.
In /etc/usb/known_usb is list of devices with serialNumber.
After copying theose files it is neccesary to update udev rules in database:

$udevadm hwdb --update


before unmounting of usb device - it must by flushing by using sync command.

ADDON: added support like 'usbfs' to /run/devices (it is simmulare to old /proc/bus/usb/devices). It is used by my projects like 'USB-Board' and 'httpd_nh221'
